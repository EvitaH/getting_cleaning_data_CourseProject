R CODEBOOK

This is the codebook for "run_analysis.R".

original datafiles used as downloaded:

features.txt
activity_labels.txt
./train/X_train.txt
./train/Y_train.txt
./train/subject_train.txt
./test/X_test.txt
./test/y_test.txt
./test/subject_test.txt

variables generated:
featinfo		contains data from features.txt read as table
myfeatmean		subset: list of all expressions from features.txt containing "mean()"
myfeatstd		subset: list of all expressions from features.txt containing "std()"
myfeat			combines myfeatmean and myfeatstd through rbind
fullist			the full list of features as in featinfo; gets modified throughout script: "activity" and "subjectID" are added as elements 562 and 563
wanted			the list of all features as in myfeat; gets modified througout script: "activity" and "subjectID" are added as elements 67 and 68. Is further modified throughout the script to remove all special characters ("(", ")", "-", ",")
Xtest			the X_test.txt file read as dataframe
Ytest			the y_test.txt file read as dataframe; gets modified: the column name gets changed to "activity"
Stest			the subject_test.txt file read as dataframe; gets modified: the column name gets changed to "subjectID"
compltest		Xtest, Ytest and Stest are combined after modifications via cbind into this dataframe
Xtrain			the X_train.txt file read as dataframe
Ytrain			the y_train.txt file read as dataframe; gets modified: the column name gets changed to "activity"
Strain			the subject_train.txt file read as dataframe; gets modified: the column name gets changed to "subjectID"
compltrain		Xtrain, Ytrain and Strain are combined after modifications via cbind into this dataframe
completedata	compltest and compltrain are combined via rbind 
dfcompletedata	modified completedata: the column names get assigned the values from fullist after fullist has been modified 
dfsubdata		subset of dfcompletedata, all columns whose names occur in the list wanted, activities changed from numerical references to characters as given in activity_labels.txt, subjectID and activity combined into one column
subdatameans	means of all numeric columns from dfsubdata grouped based on subjectID and activity combined, transformation/calculation performed with summaryBy() function

files generated:
subdatameans.txt	table output from subdatameans, tab-delimited
